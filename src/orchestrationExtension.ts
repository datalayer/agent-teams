/**
 * The Datalayer orchestration extension, standalone (ORCHESTRATOR.md, O3-01, O3-03).
 *
 * A worker and an orchestrator can say three things over plain A2A neither
 * protocol has a field for: which execution a delegation is part of and
 * where it sits in its tree, a budget the worker should decline before
 * exceeding rather than have detected after the spend, and — once the
 * worker's task or session is named — a checkpoint to resume from and an
 * instruction to steer a run already in progress.
 *
 * This module is that agreement and nothing else: no A2A SDK import, no
 * framework, no Datalayer platform dependency. An orchestrator that never
 * delegates a child sends `execution` with `depth: 0` and no parent; a
 * worker that never checkpoints never answers `paused`. Everything is
 * optional and capability-negotiated — call {@link isExtensionActive}
 * before sending anything, and a worker that never advertises the
 * extension still gets a plain A2A delegation and still answers.
 *
 * Field-for-field identical to `agent_teams.a2a.orchestration_extension`
 * (the Python implementation, in this same package) and to
 * `agent_runtimes.context.delegation` (the Datalayer platform's own,
 * proven and deployed). The published, normative specification is
 * `docs/extension-v1.md` in
 * {@link https://github.com/datalayer-research/context-orchestration-protocols | context-orchestration-protocols}.
 *
 * @example An orchestrator, dispatching
 * ```ts
 * import { buildDelegationMeta } from '@datalayer/agent-teams';
 *
 * const metadata = buildDelegationMeta(
 *   { executionId: 'exec_1', rootExecutionId: 'exec_1', depth: 0 },
 *   { budget: { outputTokens: 4000 } },
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @example A worker, answering
 * ```ts
 * import { usageMeta } from '@datalayer/agent-teams';
 *
 * const metadata = usageMeta({ inputTokens: 812, outputTokens: 140, cost: 0.0031 });
 * ```
