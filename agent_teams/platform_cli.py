"""The platform half of ``agent-teams``: catalogued teams, run on Datalayer.

A team's run is not a new kind of work on the orchestration control plane.
Starting one delegates a root execution to it — the call a benchmark's team
task makes (``activities_evals._team_chat``) and the team page's **Launch** —
and the control plane runs its supervisor and its seats as children of that
root. So every command here is a team-shaped front on what ``executions``
already does:

- ``list`` and ``show`` read the catalogue of team specs, which ships with
  agent-runtimes (``agent_runtimes.specs.teams``) — imported when asked for,
  because agent-runtimes depends on this package and not the other way round;
- ``start`` delegates a goal to a team, and can follow it;
- ``runs`` lists a team's root executions; ``status`` shows one run's tree,
  seat by seat;
- ``monitor``, ``steer``, ``pause``, ``resume``, ``cancel``, ``terminate`` and
  ``artifacts`` act on a run — its root, and through it the whole tree —
  through Datalayer core's own ``executions`` implementation, so the two never
  drift.

Needs Datalayer core (``pip install agent-teams[datalayer]``), which the
Datalayer CLI that hosts these commands always has. ``register`` adds them to
the ``agent-teams`` application (``agent_teams.cli``).
